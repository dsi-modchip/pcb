* decoupling issues @ 250 MHz!!!
* fix WS2812 not lighting up
	* needs 5V supply: https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/4684/4684_WS2812B-2020_V1.3_EN.pdf aaa
	* fix W22812 footprint (if continuing to use it)
	* other lighting thing?
* BETTER POWER SWITCHING!
	* 3V3 VALUES:
		* only usb: 3.3
		* only twl: 3.0
		* twl+usb: 2.9
		-> Rds,on is still kinda high at 3V ( https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/DMC3400SDW.pdf ),
		   try a different MOSFET instead?
		   or maybe a TS5A series??
		   no! use MIC209x-1 or TPS2553
		   fancy alts: TPS22919, TPS2116, LM66[21]00
		NOTE: MAIN PROBLEM HERE IS GLITCHING FET NOT ACTUATING 100% AT 3.0V! EVEN WITH REGULAR TWL V33 POWER RAIL! BETTER USE DIFFERENT GLITCH FET CONFIGURATION!
		---> not an issue? just need different params
	* TWL->USB power switching too slow? (huge caps on 3V3TWL leading to brownouts in RP2040 before power rail switch happens?)
		* will need proper PMIC chip to fix....
* pullups on UART? -> nah
